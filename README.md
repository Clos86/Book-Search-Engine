# Book Search Engine

This is a Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. You are able to create a profile to look up books and add them to a list of favorties.
